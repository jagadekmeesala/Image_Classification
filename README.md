# Image_Classification
The image classification project involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to categorize images into specific classes or labels. The CNN learns to extract relevant features from the images and uses them to make predictions. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in correctly identifying the objects or patterns present in the images.
